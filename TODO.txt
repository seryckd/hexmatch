// TODO
// * border highlight on preview tile
// * indicate selected tiles

// tile information
// image name, points, chance of appearing in input list

// More hexagon implementations
// proper ones - with axial, cube approaches
// http://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/

// D- need an overlay that will show currently selected tile
// D- tiles part of selection will move randomly within a 2-4 pixel boundary
//    of their existing
// D- twinkly stars over a match
// D- when selection is made tiles will explode in particle effect  (didn't like)
// -- consider showing every selection, so red, then green, then purple, etc
// -- have a miniature version of the to-be placed tile by the cursor when
//    within the grid.  if works.
// -- modify drawing code so that only redraws if there has been a change
//    (include animations in this)
// -- display border, title
// D- display score
// D- display pipe of next 5 tiles
// -- as a new 'order' is unlocked then it becomes available as a random choice
//    Have random choices come a list of random %, where the lowest order is always
//    the greatest and the highest unlocked is always the lowest

// -- after the 3rd or so level is reached there is no match, but instead the
//    hex is destroyed.
// -- hexes that are removed as part of a match go towards points.  when a points
//    limit is reached then the next piece is allowed to go on a vanished hex,
//    i.e. rebuild the map.

// -- dead tile - something that doesn't match at all
// -- bug - top tiles match to dead tile
// III need to change orders/g_tiles

// -- graphically show the order of matching

// -- every n tiles placed a water tile randomly disappears

// -- SPRITE to be changed so accepts a file definition

// -- when a selection is made then all the tiles turn to the match or maybe go translucent
      can we put a red border or some other indication all around it
